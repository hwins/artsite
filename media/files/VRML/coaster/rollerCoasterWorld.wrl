# this is the main wrl to present the space coaster
# it consists of this and 5 addtional inline files:
#
# track.wrl - Geometry Extrusions to represent the track are
# combined here. The track layout was originally laid out by
# hand using graph paper.
#
# supportColumn.wrl - this is a single support column for the
# track. It is used in supportColumns.wrl (plural)
#
# supportColumns.wrl - based on the x,y,z layout for the track.wrl
#
# coasterCarShape.wrl - the shape nodes that make up the coaster
# car. Several IndexedFaceSet nodes are used to make the different
# parts of the car.
#
# rideControl.wrl - this is where positions for the car and the
# viewpoints are contained
